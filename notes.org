* DONE nix-env-rebuild: split off into its own package
* DONE Remove nix-env-rebuild from nix-tools
* TODO Blocker for first release
** DONE Implement a syntax for specifying keep around packages
- analogue to builtins.storePath...
- Simple version
  - specify store paths in a file separate file (store-paths.nix), or
    attribute ((import packages.nix).store-paths)
  - save the store paths in dedicated profile
  - +solve conflicts somehow_+ use it as keep around packages
- How to use keep-around profile? A temparary profile?
  - temp
    - where would the packages be stored? user profile is too risky!
      deleting a path by accident would make keep-around stuff
      vulnerable for gc
  - cache
    - How to parse kept packages? just from the store path! 
      - [X] Refactor so that kept packages do not need status (they
        shouldn't actually)
      - [X] parse the list of store paths
      - [X] install to cache only when not dryrunning
      - [X] test
** WONTFIX Change "updateing" in output to "changeing" (or "building"?)
** TODO Don't use keep-around profile
saved from gc... but that does not mean we want to install it,
necessarily. Just install the store paths directly.
** TODO Rename "kept" 
- [ ] (-> updatesFromKept -> overrdingStorePaths)
- [ ] Fix output of update summary
** TODO Forward options to "nix-env -i"
** TODO Remove packages from cache profiles to keep polution of gc roots low
** TODO Clean errors about wrong config options (?)
** TODO Check out if other (nix) errors are readable/understandable
** TODO Fix todos
** TODO Readme.md
** TODO Print status, not custom "availability"
** TODO Check if we are able to recover from errors
- does anything need to be rolled back? 
** TODO Rename to nix-rebuild (as the original nix would)
** TODO Clean the cache after installing
** DONE Clean up the code
** DONE Clean up Utils.hs
** DONE Make cabal file aware of tests
* TODO Differences to Elco's suggestion
E. wants to abstract from manipulating profiles completely. From a
user perspective, installing a packages now means that it is written
to a "manifest-file" *per profile*.
- This allows to keep/store the nixpkgs attribute name for installed
  packages (as the attribute name might have disappeared from current
  nixpkgs)
- This does not allow to treat profile install as something
  temporary. Currently I treat "nix-env -i"-installed packages that
  way. I find this convenient.
- This also allows to have packages to "follow" nixpkgs in a profile,
  without a separate "packages.nix"
- Can I support that for different profiles? Do I want that?
- I also use store-path packages to *override* nixpkgs. Does that make
  sense?
* TODO Future
** TODO Implement "Availability"/Status
- parse the "will be built" output
- count the source packages
- when verbose, list them
** TODO Catch Shelly exceptions when run in "production"
and give error messages that do not reveal implementation details
(like shelly's command history traces)
** TODO Code cleanup [/]
- [ ] field names of records: fix field names of the Results record
  (e.g. renamed -> renaming)
** TODO Allow to add store paths to the package collection
** TODO Set upper bounds
preferably with a script that reads the current haskellPackages versions
** TODO Remove "formatting" dep in favor of "printf-th"
** TODO Sync keep-around
Either manage it declaratively and sync the "spec" or sync profiles somehow
** TODO Support -b flag
that only updates downloadable stuff
** TODO Show which packages are available in system
* DONE Allow to declare nixpkgs location
* DONE nix-env-rebuild: implement things as commands
- dry-run (now without args)
- build (now -x)
- switch (nix-env -ir --from-profile $REBULID_CACHE)
- [X] Use applicative notation
- [X] Implement new flags
* WONTFIX Support status for adding
Currently: 

Adding:
...
  texlive-full
  
Should be:

Adding:
...
  texlive-full (Source)
* TODO Support config files
* TODO Treat unison updates specially (or at least warn)
because unison breaks if the server does not have the same version installed
* TODO env-rebuild: support updates without version
Maybe it already works.. test it!
* WONTFIX Add version option
Every tool should support "--version". This should be done centrally in Utils.hs or similar.
* WONTFIX Find a way to test if and how keep-around packages will be rebuilt/updated
i.e. if they are available in a cache
* TODO nix-env-rebuild: also give the package attribute names in outputs
So that it is easy to update packages.nix
* TODO nix-env-rebuild: Short (less verbose) mode
- where fetch reinstalls are only counted
- and maybe some categories are listed inline, instead of one-per-line
* TODO Implement correct version comparison:
   Versions

       The upgrade operation determines whether a derivation y is an
       upgrade of a derivation x by looking at their respective name
       attributes. The names (e.g., gcc-3.3.1 are split into two
       parts: the package name (gcc), and the version (3.3.1). The
       version part starts after the first dash not following by a
       letter.  x is considered an upgrade of y if their package names
       match, and the version of y is higher that that of x.

       The versions are compared by splitting them into contiguous
       components of numbers and letters. E.g., 3.3.1pre5 is split
       into [3, 3, 1, "pre", 5]. These lists are then compared
       lexicographically (from left to right). Corresponding
       components a and b are compared as follows. If they are both
       numbers, integer comparison is used. If a is an empty string
       and b is a number, a is considered less than b. The special
       string component pre (for pre-release) is considered to be less
       than other components. String components are considered less
       than number components. Otherwise, they are compared
       lexicographically (i.e., using case-sensitive string
       comparison).

       This is illustrated by the following examples:

           1.0 < 2.3
           2.1 < 2.3
           2.3 = 2.3
           2.5 > 2.3
           3.1 > 2.3
           2.3.1 > 2.3
           2.3.1 > 2.3a
           2.3pre1 < 2.3
           2.3pre3 < 2.3pre12
           2.3a < 2.3c
           2.3pre1 < 2.3c
           2.3pre1 < 2.3q
* TODO nix-env-rebuild: Add command to add things to "keep-around"
